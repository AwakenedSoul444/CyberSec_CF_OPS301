#We start by creating or script file in Ubuntu in python form as such:
touch CH6.py
#Then we open with :
nano CH6.py
#Now that we are inside we will need to add three variables using the print() function
#We also need to have Terminal identify this as a Python script so we will do this

#by adding the following:                                          
#!/bin/python3

import os
pclookup=os.system('whoami')
netlookup=os.system('ip a')
listv=os.system('lshw -short')

print("Hello there we are going to output 3 commands that are identified below as:")
print("netlookup")
print("pclookup")
print("listv")

#We need to add the import os string in to our script so that Python/Linux will understand that we are using  commands
from the bash/unix language inside our Python script. Additionally we can also use the
import subprocess command which is actually preferred as it has greater compatability features.

#We will need to chmod +x ./CH6.py to allow our script to be ran in the bash terminal

#We will then run our script with ./CH6.py and receive our outputs.
